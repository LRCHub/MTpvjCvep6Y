All lives are lead
All tribes of people
All of their dead
All of their heroes

The skies overhead
The skies roll beneath us

The tide roars ahead
The tills roll back to zeros

I'd feel i'd feel lightning even now
I'd feel i'd feel lightning even now
I'd feel i'd feel lightning even now
But i don't know how

You'll sing one night
At your witching hour
Midnight turns into noon
Within one day of your calendar
Your world becomes a moon

I'd feel i'd feel lightning even now
I'd feel i'd feel lightning even now
I'd feel i'd feel lightning even now
But i don't know how

All lives are lead
All tribes of people
The tide roars ahead
The tills roll back to zeros
